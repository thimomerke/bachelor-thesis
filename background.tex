\section{The Necessity of Carbon Dioxide Removal}
\textcite{Bergman2021TheJustice} estimate that human activities have caused 2500 Gt\footnote{ 1 Gt = 1 billion (metric) tons} of carbon emissions into the atmosphere since 1850. This has caused the atmospheric concentration of CO\textsubscript{2} to rise from 278 ppm before the beginning of the industrial era to over 410 ppm in 2021 \parencite{Friedlingstein2022Global2022}. Anthropogenic global warming already reached 1 degree Celsius in 2017 \parencite[6]{IPCC2018Global1.5C}, and the \textcite[30]{UNEP2022Emissions2022} estimates that even in the most optimistic scenarios, the peak warming will likely exceed the 1.5-degree target.\footnote{The Mercator Institute estimates that as of May 8, 2023, the remaining carbon budget to stay below the 1.5-degree goal is roughly 262 Gt CO\textsubscript{2}, which at the current pace will be exceeded in the next seven years. The current numbers can be found at: https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/research/co2-budget.html} Similarly, a report by the \textcite[9]{NAS2018NegativeAgenda} concludes that to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, negative emissions of 10 Gt/y CO\textsubscript{2} by 2050 and 20 Gt/y CO\textsubscript{2} by 2100 are required.\footnote{For an overview of the projected pathway and actual carbon emissions, see Appendix A.}\\
Additionally, while for most sectors and industries the cost of CO\textsubscript{2} abatement through emission avoidance or capture is significantly lower than the projected cost of most CDR strategies, there are some hard-to-avoid emissions, e.g. from agriculture and air transportation. This means that even after an atmospheric concentration of CO\textsubscript{2} in accordance with the goals of the Paris Agreement is reached, some carbon removal will be required to offset the remaining emissions and ensure the concentration of CO\textsubscript{2} remains stable \parencite{NRC2015ClimateSequestration}.\footnote{The amount of CDR required depends on the definition of \textit{hard-to-avoid emissions}. Although many definitions include any emissions for which their high financial cost makes CO\textsubscript{2} abatement unviable, \textcite{Bergman2021TheJustice} only include emissions that cannot be avoided for physical reasons or whose avoidance would cause unacceptable social injustice, and warn against using proposed future CDR strategies as an argument to avoid emission reduction in the present.}
\section{Definition of Carbon Dioxide Removal}
There are a number of different definitions of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR), all of which are broadly equal, but slightly differ in the scope of strategies and technologies they include. For example, the \textcite[544]{IPCC2018Global1.5C} defines CDR as "anthropogenic activities removing CO\textsubscript{2} from the atmosphere and durably storing it in geological, terrestrial or ocean reservoirs, or in products", which suggests that any kind of carbon capture or storage constitutes CDR, given that the carbon was taken from the atmosphere and not from a single point source. The \textcite[1]{NAS2018NegativeAgenda} use the term Negative Emission Technologies (NETs) instead, which they define as strategies "which remove carbon from the atmosphere and sequester it." More recently, \textcite{Smith2023TheEdition} argued that CDR must follow the three principles (1) of removing carbon from the atmosphere, (2) using durable\footnote{ Smith et. al define durable storage as storage that "has a characteristic timescale on the order of decades or more".} storage, and (3) being the result of active human intervention. All these definitions imply that CDR can be divided into approaches that capture CO\textsubscript{2} from the atmosphere, such as Direct Air Capture, approaches that store CO\textsubscript{2}, such as geological storage or in-situ mineralization, and approaches that capture and store CO\textsubscript{2}, such as land management or afforestation and reforestation. This thesis focuses only on strategies and technologies that capture or capture and store carbon, excluding storage-only strategies.
\section{Natural and Technological CDR strategies}
CDR strategies can be grouped into biological approaches, geochemical approaches, both of which mostly rely on using or enhancing natural processes, and chemical approaches, which use technological processes involving chemical solvents or sorbents \parencite{Smith2023TheEdition}.\\
Biological capture processes include land-management strategies that aim to increase the amount of CO\textsubscript{2} stored in e.g. agriculturally-used soil and afforestation and reforestation, as well as some ocean-based processes.
Geochemical capture processes are based on using natural weathering and mineralization processes, artificially fertilizing the oceans or increasing their alkalinity to boost their ability to absorb CO\textsubscript{2}.
Chemical processes use novel, technological processes that involve solid or liquid solvents, which absorb CO\textsubscript{2} from the atmosphere and release it in concentrated form for storage.\\
The approaches discussed in this thesis are largely those that were considered by the National Academies in their 2018 research agenda.
\section{Current State of CDR Research and Development}
In the past years, the investment into CDR research and development of CDR projects has increased substantially \parencite{Smith2023TheEdition}. However, the development of the various CDR strategies is currently in very different stages. Biological processes have a large literature, are well understood, and are presumed cheaper to deploy at the present time, but may be less durable and face greater limitations in their total potential due to natural constraints \parencite{Fuss2018NegativeEffects}. In comparison, chemical processes are still in their infancy and are only deployed on a small scale \parencite{Smith2023TheEdition}.\\
Uncertainty also exists about the contribution CDR can make to climate change mitigation efforts in general. While some reports (e.g. \textcite{NAS2018NegativeAgenda}) include the use of large amounts of CDR in the future as a necessity to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement, \textcite{Fuss2018NegativeEffects} argue that CDR is no alternative to rapid and sustainable reductions in carbon emissions and warn against over-reliance on CDR, citing the uncertainty and risks involved in its large-scale deployment.\\
\section{Economic Viability of CDR}
Since carbon removal is generally costly and does not have an immediate benefit for its producer, the economic viability of CDR depends on a carbon price instituted by systems such as the European Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS), which requires companies in an increasing number of industries to buy carbon certificates and allows trading between companies, or on a government-enforced carbon tax. Presently (June 2023), the price for one ton of carbon dioxide produced in the EU-ETS is 79 €\footnote{The current price can be found at https://ember-climate.org/data/data-tools/carbon-price-viewer/.} (85 USD), after exceeding 100 € for the first time in February of this year. Other definitions of carbon costs include the total cost of social damage caused by carbon emissions, with different models proposing prices in a wide range between 50 USD and 5000 USD \parencite{Kikstra2021TheVariability}. This thesis uses the definition instituted by \textcite{Griscom2017NaturalSolutions}, who define a price of 100 USD/t CO\textsubscript{2} as cost-effective based on the social costs that would result from excessive CO\textsubscript{2} emissions by 2030.
